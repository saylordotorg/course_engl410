**Unit 5: Science, Psychology and the Victorian Novel** <span
id="5"></span> 
The Industrial Revolution that took place over the course of the
Victorian Era meant that very rapid changes occurred in the ways and
means of labor. As we learned in Unit 1, class structure and
stratification were very important, and men and women had separate
spheres of labor. The enormous changes of science and technology
destabilized this, however; so, even as the categories for work were
being defined, they were also being challenged. Some of this is evident
in the technology used in the last novel, *Dracula*. However, there were
other “revolutions” happening during this period, particularly in the
natural and physical sciences and in medicine. In this Unit, we will
examine how theories of natural selection, evolution, and psychology
(influenced by the rise in empire and industry) affected society – and
the novels that describe it. A reciprocal relationship also existed
between science, psychology, and the novel. Some medical professionals
even borrowed language from Charles Dickens!  
  
 Guiding Questions:  

-   How do changes in science, technology and medicine threaten or
    destabilize Victorian notions of class and separate spheres?
-   How do the early theories of psychology challenge or reinforce
    stereotypical ideas of class and gender in Victorian England?
-   In what ways do new discoveries influence novels? Reciprocally, in
    what ways to novels provide a necessary testing ground for the new
    discoveries of science?
-   How do theories like evolution affect political thought –
    particularly Marxism?
-   How do changes in psychology and scientific theory affect concepts
    of morality and spirituality? How does the shift toward more secular
    thinking get represented in later novels by Dickens or Hardy?

**5.5 Victorian Novelist as Social Critic: Returning to Dickens** <span
id="5.5"></span> 
*In the five units of this course, we have explored how the Victorian
novel was influenced by changes in culture – but also how the novelists
themselves remarked upon, critiqued and influenced that culture. As we
conclude our survey, I ask you to return to the work of Charles Dickens,
and to re-imagine the novelist as a social critic. I hope you have
enjoyed the course and the strange, wonderful world of the Victorian
novel.*

     Instructions: Spend a few minutes reflecting on the last readings
    of this course. The last few novels use different strategies to
    reveal the failures of human nature. Like Dickens’ earlier novels,
    however, the novels are making comments on the society that
    surrounds them and incorporating realism, psychology and science to
    support their stories. Now consider the last reading on the author
    as a social critic. What does it mean for the novel to be “a
    repository of social conscience”? Share your thoughts on the
