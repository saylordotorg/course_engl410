**Unit 2: History and Conventions of the Victorian Novel** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The Victorian novel has become one of the hallmarks of our literary
tradition. Though the form originated in the 18thcentury, the
serialized, lengthy, triple-decker narratives of the Victorian period
are often what we think of when we think of novels. This section of the
course will introduce some of the types of novels in the period, as well
as the literary scene and some of its most influential authors. At the
end of this unit, we will read the entirety of Charles Dickens’ Bleak
House; though not the earliest of the Victorian novelists, his work is
representative not only in form but also in content, making plain the
cultural concerns facing a steadily urbanizing Britain.*  
  
 Guiding Questions:  

-   In what ways are Victorian novels like novels we read today? How do
    they differ? Does this change the way we approach them?
-   What can the type of novel tell us about its content?
-   What is *realism* and how does it challenge society’s *norms*?
-   In what ways does Dickens’ narrative style influence our reading of
    his text? Does it help us sympathize with the story and its
    characters?

**2.3 Case Study in the Victorian Novel 2: Charles Dickens' Bleak
House** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*Charles Dickens’ Bleak House is a very important novel for several
reasons: It represents several different classes of characters, from the
very poor to the very wealthy, it illustrates gender expectations, and
it exposes a flawed legal system and its damaging effects. The novel
also serves as an example of how novels could create or support social
reform. Bleak House was part of a movement that sought to reform
Chancery court, and so had an influence on the legal reforms of the
1870s. Instead of making the argument directly, however, the novel (and
others like it), encourage readers to identify with characters and to
care about their fates. By creating sympathetic participation, Bleak
House encourages its readers to feel anger, frustration, excitement and
even horror as the plot unfolds. The novel also has elements of a type
of genre developing in the period: the mystery or crime novel. For all
of these reasons, Bleak House is an excellent example of the Victorian
novel, though it is not the earliest incarnation of it. Likewise, though
Dickens is certainly not the only important novelist in the Victorian
period, he is often considered representative.*

    is a length and complex novel with many themes, but for this forum,
    reflect first on the negative impact of the court system. To what
    extent are the characters responsible for what happens to them? To
    what extent is the system responsible? How is Dickens using concepts
    of morality and sympathy to characterize people and systems?
    Secondly, focus on the divisions between class and gender. How does
    Esther’s sacrificial behavior reflect ideas about women and their
    sphere of influence? What about the expectations for young men?
