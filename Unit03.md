**Unit 3: The Woman Question: Gender and the Victorian Novel** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Victorian novels often represent and explore deeply complicated and
interconnected social worlds. In this unit of the course, we will
investigate the complexity of gender in the Victorian novel. This was a
period of enormous change, and though women were granted additional
rights, they lived and worked in a patriarchal society that expected
them to be, primarily, wives and mothers. The marriage plot is therefore
an important component of these novels, but novelists also used their
work to challenge gender roles and expectations. In the following, we
will look at gender and work, gender and politics, gender in the home,
and gender in sensation novels. We will conclude the unit with Charlotte
Bronte’s Jane Eyre and Wilkie Collins’ The Woman in White.*  
  
 Guiding Questions:

-   Why did men and women inhabit separate spheres? Why were men in the
    public and women in the private sphere?
-   How did the woman question relate to social policies? In what ways
    was it addressed or represented in fiction?
-   We addressed women’s work earlier in the course. In what ways did
    women’s work (in private, as governesses, as wives/mothers) make
    them potentially vulnerable? In what ways did it affect their
    ability to speak out against things that were wrong?
-   In *Bleak House*, emotion and sympathy are used to influence the
    reader’s feelings about social policy. How do sensation novels use
    emotional effect? Is it used for different purposes?
