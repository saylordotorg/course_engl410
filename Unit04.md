**Unit 4: The British Empire and the Victorian Novel** <span
id="4"></span> 
*It was once said that the “sun never set” on the British Empire; this
phrase (which has been attributed to several persons) appeared in 1821
in a British newspaper, the Caledonian Mercury. It meant that the
territorial expansion of the 18th and 19th century gave the United
Kingdom extensive land holdings around the world (notably in India). But
though this empire was powerful, it was also under threat. The optimism
of the early 19th century fades into a fear of collapse, decay and
invasion at the end of the Victorian period. These themes necessarily
capture the British imagination, and it is important to note that the
Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire was also published during this time
(you will have noted a reference to it in Bleak House; it is read to the
Boffins by Silas Wegg!) In this unit, we will examine the theme of
empire and its representation in novels of the period.*  
  
 Guiding Questions:  

-   How did colonial expansion influence trade routes? Did it increase
    wealth? For whom? Who benefits and who suffers?
-   As the empire became threatened, what did the Victorians fear would
    happen? How did these fears influence policy – and how were they
    represented in fiction?
-   In what ways are Gothic novels used to address the problems of
    empire and of decline?
