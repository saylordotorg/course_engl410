The Victorian Period of English history (1837-1901) witnessed a set of
complex political, social, scientific, medical and philosophical
developments. Such developments influenced - and were influenced by -
various modes of cultural production, most specifically the Victorian
Novel. The reciprocal relationship meant that even as discoveries fed
the imaginative worlds of fiction, fictive accounts helped a reading
public re imagine the language of those discoveries. As the British
Empire expanded its reaches across the globe, news of new societies and
cultures circulated back to the British Isles to a degree never before
witnessed in English history. At home, British intellectuals began
raising important questions concerning the nature of the "Woman
Question," or the proper place and role for British women in society, at
home, and in the workplace. In addition, this period saw the rise of
Darwinism, Marxism, and Freudian psychoanalysis - a set of theories that
would forever change global society and culture. In this course, we will
study the ways in which the Victorian novel came to grapple with these
and other related ideas and issues, and we will track the methods by
which the novels of this age represented (and intervened in) social,
political, scientific, philosophical, and cultural concerns. The course
has been arranged to first acquaint you with the broader
socio-historical and literary context in which Victorian novels
bourgeoned and flourished. In addition to this cultural context, there
are ten "Case Studies in the Victorian Novel," along with a few shorter
fiction readings. The course is divided into five units that may be
described briefly as: Victorian Socio-Historical Context, Conventions of
the Victorian Novel, Gender and the Victorian Novel, Empire and the
Victorian Novel, and Science and the Victorian Novel. You will be asked
to think deeply about the ways culture influences text - but also about
how novels and novelists affect their culture. Though the Victorian Age
has long past, our current understanding of novels (their content and
structure) owes a debt to the great novelists of the nineteenth century.
