**Unit 1: Socio-historical Context: An Introduction to the Victorian
Period** <span id="1"></span> 
*The Victorian period coincides, of course, with the reign of Queen
Victoria. This age experienced, among other things, the rapid expansion
of the British Empire, the emergence of revolutionary forms of
technology and science, the birth of new theories concerning ideal
social relations, widespread industrialization, and the invention of a
new formation of the novel that would forever change the trajectory of
narrative: the Victorian novel. In this section of the course, we will
explore these and other related issues with the goal of arriving at a
global view of Victorianism, identifying its principal characteristics,
practitioners, and conventions.*  
  
 Guiding Questions:  

-   What were the complexities of class relations in Victorian England?
-   In what ways did industrialization cause class tension?
-   How did gender influence what kinds of work a person could do?
-   How did the novels of the time reflect these concerns in fiction?
